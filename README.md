# TrustChain Settlement Core (MVP Focus)

TrustChain focuses on one core capability:

> **Off-chain AI agent intent (EIP-712 signed) -> on-chain verifiable settlement**

This repo is intentionally centered on proving that core flow end-to-end:

1. Off-chain actor signs typed intent.
2. Contract verifies signer, amount, nonce/replay, and deadline.
3. Escrowed funds settle to recipient with deterministic accounting.

For roadmap and scope discipline, see: `docs/FOCUS_ROADMAP.md`

## Current Module Posture

Primary (V1 first-class):

- auth verification (`AuthTokenManager`, `EIP712Auth`)
- settlement lifecycle (`BillManager`)
- escrow accounting + payout (`LockPoolManager`)
- minimal emergency stop (`CircuitBreaker`)

Secondary/deferred in narrative:

- richer identity/policy expansion (`KYARegistry` beyond minimal checks)
- broader feature combinations not required for signature-to-settlement proof

## Prerequisites

Install Foundry (macOS/Linux):

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

Verify installation:

```bash
forge --version
```

Install `forge-std` test library:

```bash
forge install foundry-rs/forge-std
```

## Build

From project root:

```bash
forge build
```

## Test

Run core narrative demo first (recommended):

```bash
forge test --match-path "contracts/test/ScenarioFlow.t.sol" -vv
```

Run all tests:

```bash
forge test -vv
```

Run a single test file:

```bash
forge test --match-path "contracts/test/KYARegistry.t.sol" -vv
```

Run invariant/fuzz tests:

```bash
forge test --match-path "contracts/test/LockPoolManager.invariant.t.sol" -vv
forge test --match-path "contracts/test/CrossModuleAccounting.invariant.t.sol" -vv
forge test --match-path "contracts/test/BillStateMachine.invariant.t.sol" -vv
```

## Notes

- Demo-first message: prove signed-intent settlement correctness before adding breadth.
- Keep decisions tied to settlement reliability and integration simplicity.
- `BatchSettlement` is a deprecated compatibility wrapper; use `BillManager` directly.
