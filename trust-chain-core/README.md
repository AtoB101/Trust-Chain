# trust-chain-core (Public)

This public repository exposes the verifiable settlement protocol baseline:

- core smart contracts
- public interfaces
- basic SDK interfaces/mocks
- minimal runnable demos
- public documentation

Commercial strategy logic is intentionally excluded and belongs in `trust-chain-engine` (private).

## Public Scope

- `contracts/`: base settlement lifecycle and protocol interfaces
- `sdk/basic/`: public SDK types/interfaces and mock adapters
- `docs/public/`: open documentation only
- `examples/`: minimal demo usage

## Quick Start

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
forge build
forge test -q
```

Frontend demo:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8787
```
